# CPE-800-Link-Prediction
## Introduction
A research study on Link prediction using Graphs, part of the CPE - 800 projects at Stevens Institute of Technology. I am majorly focusing on studying methods of Link Prediction on Graphs. I will include the links to all the references in the coming sections. 

## Approach
- [x] 1. Researching about the topic and reading research papers about existing implementations.
- [x] 2. Study the heuristic methods before implementing **ideal** implementations. 
- [x] 3. Implement heuristic methods and visualize performance.
- [x] 4. Analyze heuristic methods and prepare mid-stage reports. 
- [x] 5. Read about GNN and the pre-requisites.
- [x] 6. Start Implementing GNN for SEAL.
- [ ] 7. Implementing SEAL
